gridr		smoothing and reducing on distance
		reducing uses also depth value

strategy:
	either give inodes or sigma/reduct

	weights w are computed from background grid or depth values
		background takes precedence
		where no background is available, use depth
		no depth, w=1
		if depth = -1, w=0

	if inodes are given this is used to compute reduct and sigma
		lengthscale is computed
		reduct = reduct*lengthscale
		sigma = sigma*lengthscale
		(reduct and sigma are extra factors, if not given 1)

	if inodes not given, then use directly reduct and sigma
		reduct and sigma are lengthscale
		
	dist*w < reduct	=> eliminate
